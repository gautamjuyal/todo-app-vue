[TTS API](https://rapidapi.com/voicerss/api/text-to-speech-1/)
Note: (1) The api requires two keys, one can be generated by signing up for [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/) website, another one can be generated by signing up for [voicerss](http://www.voicerss.org/api/) website.
(2) The api returns audio file (and not a link), therefore make sure to set b64 to true in encodedParams.
